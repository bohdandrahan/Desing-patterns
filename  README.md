## Description:
This is my personal log of different design patterns implemented <br>
in Python. It is not a list of perfect abstract examples nor <br>
 the real world cases. It is rather a try to recreate the patterns <br>
  in a way I understood them. <br>

Feel free to use it as an example. <br>
If you have any questions or suggestions feel free to contact me.
