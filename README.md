## Description:
This is my personal log of different design patterns implemented
in Python. <br>
It is not a list of perfect abstract examples nor
 the real world cases. <br>
 It is rather a try to recreate the patterns
  in a way I understood them. <br>
I've tried to keep it as simple as possible, to help understand the core. <br> 

Feel free to use it as an example. <br>
If you have any questions or suggestions feel free to contact me.
